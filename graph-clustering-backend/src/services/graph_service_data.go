// This file is now minimal since most data retrieval functions 
// are moved to graph_service.go to match controller expectations.
// 
// The main functions (GetHierarchyData, GetSupernodeCoordinates, GetNodeStatistics)
// are now in graph_service.go with the exact signatures that controllers expect.
